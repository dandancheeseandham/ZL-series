# Summary

KITS ARE NOW AVAILABLE: https://www.projectr3d.com/products/


RailcoreII is a Core-XY based Reprap 3d printer designed by J. Steve White & Tony Akens.  The initial idea to collaborate on a printer started in the #RepRap IRC channel, and centered on some common goals we both had in mind for a new printer design.

    Core-XY motion.
    All Linear rails for movement
    Space & Cost Efficient, enclosable frame
    Key components being printable, or able to be milled
    Flexibility and Scalability in the design
    A professional looking printer
    Self Sourced and Easily customizable

Steve had previously built the “railcore”, the “alpha” version of this printer.  We took what he’d learned from it, and began the design on the new printer.  All design work was done in Fusion360. 

As we progressed, we decided to “publish” this printer in an open, documented format for others to build as well.

The frame is designed to be 1515 aluminum extrusion.  This was a space efficient choice, and it makes building the printer easy, as standard M3 hardware works like a T-Nut, fitting into the extrusion nicely.  To add rigidity, we originally used melamine sides to stiffen the frame.  We've since switched to using milled HDPE side panels.  (These can be cut out of any material you prefer, including plywood, acrylic, aluminum, etc).  The total cost for the actual frame components (Extrusion, corner cubes, and sides) is roughly $100.

From there, some key design decisions were to make the build volume a 250mm cube.  This kept the total printer size to what we considered reasonable.  The design is easily expandable to 300mm cubed, and a new version at these dimesnions is forthcoming.  Some notable aspects of the design: dual leadscrew Z-Axis with a belt drive between them, Stacked idlers duo-planar belt path, and lots of flexibility.  The electronics in the design are the Duet (Wifi or Ethernet), 24v PSU, 0.9 degree steppers.  We used an E3D v6 for the design, as it’s the most common hotend at this time.  Support for other hotends will be forthcoming (needing only a different Y carriage).  Semi-Direct drive or full bowden is supported.

A special thanks to Filastruder, Duet3d, E3D, SeeMeCNC, and 713Maker for supporting the project.

10/23/17 Update: Almost all the files renamed to match the BOM and documentation better.  Orientation of all models fixed to show how to best print them.

2/11/18 Update: Front & Back X carriages updated, Front and Back Stationary Idler Carriers updated.
